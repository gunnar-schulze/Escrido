 *  @par        "Escrido" is a tool that generates LaTeX and web documents of
 *              references and manuals for code and/or programming languages.
 *              It is strongly influenced by Doxygen and has a similar syntax.
 *              Nevertheless it differs from Doxygen in several points:
 *              - Escrido is not bound to any programming language. This allows
 *                the markup text to be stored in any place, not only the
 *                original code file. In the same way elements that have no
 *                actual source code can be documented by Escrido.
 *              - Its output can be controlled easily by the use of template
 *                files.
 *              - It uses markup deliminators &#47;*#, #*&#47; and &#47;&#47;#
 *                that can neutrally coexist with Doxygen markup.
 *              - Syntax is keept as similar to Doxygen as possible. Nevertheless
 *                there are certain deviations from the Doxygen syntax.
 *              - Certain commands extend the functionality of Doxygen, like
 *                the @ref tag_table "&#64;table" command.
 *              - Some Doxygen functions are not supported.
 *
 *  @par        See the example files for a quick start into Escrido.
